# C-code-Resultant-Force
C Programme to calculate resultant force

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I (Naveen Nakkeeran) developed this code for one of my Duke of Edinburgh Silver medal activities

- I learnt in higher physics how to calculate the resultant force in terms of horizontal and vertical directions

- When I learnt C Programming language, I tried to develop a C code for the calculation of the resultant vector force

- This c code is OS independent
